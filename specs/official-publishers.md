# Official Publishers

`official` is a ClawHub publisher policy flag derived from ClawHub-managed
`officialPublishers` rows.

For now, Official means:

- a publisher is Official only when that exact publisher has an
  `officialPublishers` row
- official status is publisher-scoped; it is not inherited by users, personal
  publishers, org members, GitHub identities, OIDC trust, or `trustedPublisher`

Official must not be accepted from uploaded skill or package metadata.
Membership in an official org does not make a member's personal publisher
Official. There is no generic public endpoint for marking arbitrary publishers
Official.

The same policy signal appears in two places:

- Publisher/profile UI: official publishers show an `Official` badge.
- Owned package UI: new public packages from Official publishers use the
  `official` channel; private packages stay private.
- GitHub Skill Sync UI/backend: only manageable Official publishers can
  configure source-backed GitHub skill sync.

`trustedPublisher` is an internal automated-publish permission. It does not make
a publisher or package Official.
